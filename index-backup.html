Hi there! My name is Qiong Cao (pronunciation in IPA: [tɕʰi̯ʊŋ](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/pronunciation/qiong) [tsʰaʊ](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/pronunciation/cao). Chinese: 曹琼). I'm currently a fifth year PhD student at Johns Hopkins University working with [Dr. Lisa Feigenson](https://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/lisa-feigenson/) in the [Johns Hopkins University Lab for Child Development](https://labforchilddevelopment.com/). Before Hopkins, I obtained my MA in Psychology at New York University and my BS in Psychology from Zhejiang University, China.

I'm broadly interested in the early representations and computations that guide learning. Especially, how children select information to reason about the causal structures of the physical and social world. There are three main lines of research during my PhD training: children's representation of coincidences, infants and preschoolers' reasoning about agents' competence and performance, and surprise-induced learning in infancy. You can read more about my research [here](/research/).
