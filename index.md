Hi there! My name is Qiong Cao (IPA: [tɕʰi̯ʊŋ](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/pronunciation/qiong) [tsʰaʊ](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/pronunciation/cao)
; Chinese: 曹琼). I'm a fifth year PhD student at Johns Hopkins University working
with [Dr. Lisa Feigenson](https://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/lisa-feigenson/) in
the [JHU Lab for Child Development](https://labforchilddevelopment.com/). Previously, I
obtained my MA in Psychology at New York University and my BS in Psychology from Zhejiang University, China.

I'm broadly interested in the early representations and computations that guide learning. Especially, how children
select information to reason about the causal structures of the physical and social world. There are three main lines of
research during my PhD training: children's representation of coincidences, infants and preschoolers' reasoning about
agents' competence and performance, and surprise-induced learning in infancy. You can read more about [my
research here](/research/).

When I'm not working, I enjoy listening to [soft music](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjKI5ONdAyGS01UfxE2alDJZ-ffOFPM73), watching clouds and flowers, and adoring my lovely [cat](/assets/images/yurekwithplants.jpg) or helping the less fortunate cats in shelters.
