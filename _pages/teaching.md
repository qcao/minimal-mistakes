## Course

### How to build a mind: Lessons from babies, animals, and AI
This is a self-proposed upper level undergraduate course through the Dean's Teaching Fellowship at Johns Hopkins University. 

In this course, we will tackle questions about the mind and intelligence in different cognitive systems. To explore the origins of human intelligence, we will examine early cognitive abilities in human infants. To better understand what makes human thinking similar to and different from that of other complex systems, we will dive into research on non-human animals and artificial intelligence. We will start with discussions of topics such as “What counts as intelligence?” and “How does learning occur?” Then we will consider how different cognitive systems might work by exploring five cognitive abilities known to be important for human cognition: intuitive physics, intuitive psychology, numerical cognition, causal reasoning, and language.

## Mentorship

Research is not only about science, but also about the people who do science. I deeply value the opportunities to learn and grow alongside my mentees.

I understand that everyone comes with different goals objectives, and I cherish the diversity of perspectives each person brings. I try my best to offer tailored guidance to fit each student's unique needs and aspirations.

My goal is to not only guide my mentees in reaching their academic goals, but also to cultivate skills and mindsets that will benefit them in the long run.
